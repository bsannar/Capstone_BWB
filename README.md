# Welcome!
All of the files you need to work on this project are found within the BWB_GUI directory. There is an Assets folder which contains default mission parameters for the Tanker, Airdrop, and Cargo Carry missions. Additionally this folder contains the BWB_tanker.xlsl, KC135.xlsl, and C17.xlsl jet files which are used by the DST for calculating performance.
